Recently I've been trying PhysX4.0 for physical simulation. There is a very interesting and complete demo attached in the package. I think it is very great and intuitive to try this demo on our own computers. However, the tutorial details are rare. I only found a tutorials written in Japanese. I will post what I did in here just for the record.

# 0. Preparation

**Required environment**

- CMake, minimum version 3.12 (3.13.4 for uwp arm64, 3.14 for vc16win*)
- Python, minimum version 2.7.6
- Microsoft DirectX SDK June 2010 or later
- Requires CUDA 10.0 compatible display driver and CUDA ARCH 3.0 compatible GPU (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#GPUs_supported" target="_blank">check you GPU here</a>)

**My environment**

- Windows 10 x64
- Visual Studio 2017 Community (VC14)
- CMake v3.18.0-rc3
- Microsoft DirectX SDK June 2010
- Python 3.7.2
- Geforce GTX 1080i

---

# 1. Environment Setup

**a) Visual Studio 2017 and GPU driver**

I will skip this step. 

**b) CMake** [<a href="https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/tag/v3.18.0-rc3" target="_blank">download</a>]

CMake version 3.20.0 won't work for me, I don't know the reason but the version 3.18.0-rc3 can work. Just download <u>cmake-3.18.0-rc3-win64-x64.msi</u> and run it. Remember to check the box of adding CMake to the environment path during installation, or manually add CMake to the path. After that, try <u>cmake --version</u> in terminal to verify the installation. 

**c) Microsoft DirectX SDK June 2010** [<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812" target="_blank">download</a>]

Download Microsoft DirectX SDK if you don't have one. If you ran into `Error Code: S1023` during installation, I also write the solution as appendix at the end of this post. Please find it there. 

Record the installation directory here, we will need it after. In my case, the installation directory is something like <u>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010)</u>. 

**d) Clone the repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/PhysX.git
```

# 2. Build PhysX4

**a) Generate solutions**

Open <u>PhysX-4.0\physx</u> and execute <u>generate_projects.bat</u>, it can generates visual studio solutions automatically based on the parameters as follows. In my case, I select the fourth parameter (4) vc14win64. 

After executing this bash file, you will find generated solution in the folder <u>PhysX/physx/compiler/vc14win64</u> where my preset windows platform is vc14win64. 

If you ran into some problems, check whether it is <u>MSBuild path</u> or <u>CMake problem</u>. Solve them using following methods. 

- *Problem*: MSBuild path

```
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:34 (project):
    Failed to run MSBuild command: 
    MSBuild.exe  
```

- *Solution*: add the path of <u>MSBuild.exe</u> to the environment path. In my case, it's in <u>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\MSBuild\15.0\Bin</u>. It should be similar with mines. 

- *Problem*: CMake problem

```
CMake Error at C:/Program Files/CMake/share/cmake-3.18/Modules/CMakeDetermineCompilerABI.cmake:48 (try_compile):
    Failed to open
        C:/Users/matsu/Documents/PhysX-4.0/physx/compiler/vc14win64/CMakeFiles/CMakeTmp/CMakeLists.txt
    Permission denied
~~~ 
CMake Error at C:/Program Files/CMake/share/cmake-3.18/Modules/CMakeTestCCompiler.cmake:66 (message):
      The C compiler
          "C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0/VC/bin/x86_amd64/cl.exe"
      is not able to compile a simple test program.
      It fails with the following output:

```

- *Solution*: downgrade the version of your CMake to v3.18.0-rc3. I'm not sure about if this is a correct solution. But my CMake 3.20+ won't work. 

**b) Build PhysX4 in VS2017**

Open <u>PhysX\physx\compiler\vc14win64\PhysXSDK.sln</u> in VS2017. When you open VS2017, you may see window like this. Just click cancel. 

<img src="https://xinyizzzhang.github.io/images/post3_warning.jpg" height="300">


First thing to do is to add the path of Microsoft DirectX SDK to the library directory of corresponding projects in VS2017. You only need add to two projects: <u>SampleRender</u> and <u>SamplePlatform</u>. 

Right click these **project -> Property -> VC++ Directory -> Library Directory -> Edit**, then **copy the path** <u>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010)\Lib\x64</u> here like the figure shows. Otherwise, you will get error such as "d3dx9.h: No such file or directory". 

<img src="https://xinyizzzhang.github.io/images/post3_add_path.PNG">


Then, we can build PhysX4. In my case, I select <u>release/x64</u>. **Right click ALL_BUILD -> Build**. 

And all files are built in the folder <u>PhysX\physx\bin\win.x86_64.vc140.mt\release</u>. Done. If you further plan to use PhysX4, there are the libraries you will use. 



# 3. Build Kepla Demo

Open <u>PhysX\kaplademo\source\compiler\vc14win64-PhysX_4.0\KaplaDemo.sln</u> in VS2017. Select release and x64. **Right click KaplaDemo -> Build**. 

Then all files are built in the folder <u>PhysX\kaplademo\bin\VC14WIN64\RELEASE</u> including the exectable application **KeplaDemo.exe**. 

---

# 4. Run Kepla Demo

Execute <u>PhysX\kaplademo\bin\VC14WIN64\RELEASE\KeplaDemo.exe</u>. Press F1 to see more operations. I will show me playing this as these gif shows. I find it is potentially interesting to simulate deformable objects in robotic manipulation field.

If you have compiler error in this step. Maybe you should check you GPU setting. Make sure you're running this application using GPU instead of an Intel graphic card.

### Appendix: Microsoft DirectX SDK error

When you install Microsoft DirectX SDK when you get error:

```
`Error Code: S1023` during installation
```

Just follow the solution here [<a href="ttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/4102259/directx-sdk-june-2010-installation-problems-error-code-s1023" target="_blank">stackoverflow</a>]. I will summerize this solution and post it here. 

**a) Check the reason**

The reason may be that you have a higher version of Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 x64 (or x86) Redistributable. 

Open the folder <u>C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Temp</u>, find some file name like <u>Microsoft Visual C++ 2010  x64 Redistributable Setup_20211110_180658877.html</u>. Open it you will see

<img src="https://xinyizzzhang.github.io/images/post3_sdk_error.jpg" width=700>

**b) Uninstall higher version**
If you see it, just go to Setting -> Application, uninstall the <u>Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 x64 (or x86) Redistributable</u> whose version is higher than, e.g. 10.0.30319 as the red array pointing in the following figure.

**c) Run the installation**

Re-run the installer, this time you won't get that error.
